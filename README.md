# RocketModPlugin-Phone
The plugin adds a number system and the ability to send messages to other players.
### Configuration:
I don't see the point in explaining it, it's all self-explanatory.

### Commands:
- /phone buy - buy a phone.
- /phone register - register a SIM card.
- /phone info - get information about the number and balance.
- /phone addbalance \<value> - top up balance;
- /phone sms <recipient's number> \<message> - send a message to the player. It is possible without "".

### Permissions:
- phone

P.s.: The plugin was written back in 2019 and was abandoned and forgotten. At the same time this mod was created for it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1801828948
